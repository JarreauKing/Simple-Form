# Mobile First Responsive Contact Form Featuring Grid CSS

## Overview
In this project I have built a responsive mobile first contact form using HTML and CSS. I have used CSS3 styling along with a bit of Grid CSS layout. Also used are some icons from font awesome and a simple entry animation using animate.css. This project comes from a tutorial by [Brad Traversy](https://github.com/bradtraversy) of [Traversy Media](https://traversymedia.com/).
